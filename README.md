# Student Exam Score Prediction

Machine learning project that predicts student exam scores based on study habits and academic history.

## Dataset

- 200 students from Kaggle: ["Analyzing Student Academic Trends"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadaliyaseen/analyzing-student-academic-trends)
- Features: hours studied, sleep hours, attendance %, previous exam scores
- Target: exam score

## Models

- Multiple Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Key Findings

1. **Hours studied** - most important factor
2. **Previous exam score** - second most influential
3. **Attendance %** - moderately important
4. **Sleep hours** - least significant

This project was interesting to conduct. Exploring the relationship between study habits and academic performance was engaging, especially when analyzed using the decision tree model.
More details on the methodology and analysis can be found in `report/ML_project.pdf`.
